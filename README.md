# Weather Dashboard

## Description
For this challenge, we created an interactive weather dashboard that integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather and future forecasts. Once the API was integrated, I created functionality to show the current weather and 5-day estimates based on which city the user entered into the search field. The user is then shown the current weather for the city they searched, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. Once added, a new entry in the search history is created, and the user can click it to pull up the weather info from that previous search. There's also a button to clear the search history. All the information entered is saved in localStorage as a string called "Saved Searches."
